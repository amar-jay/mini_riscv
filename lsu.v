LSU stands for Load-Store Unit, and it is a crucial component in the design of 
modern processor architectures. The Load-Store Unit (LSU) is responsible for 
handling all memory load and store operations in a processor. 

Its main functions include:

- Load / Store operations to/from memory
- LSU handles address calculations, such as base-plus-offset or indexed addressing.
- Alignment and Endianness Handling
- Execution Pipelining


The design and implementation of the LSU can have a significant impact on the
overall performance and efficiency of a processor, especially in workloads with
a high degree of memory access.
